1- Sign or create your account at https://lab.quantum-computing.ibm.com/
2- Upload this file into the “IBM Quantum Lab platform.”
3- Run code to see results: graph or circuit by following the next steps;
4- Enable or comment in the commented-out lines (denoted by the # symbol) for 
   a specific scenario or outcome as discussed within the code comments satisfying 
   the “Objectives” (the qubit algorithmic coding steps) of the QDF-LC algorithm.    
5- Evaluate such results by consulting these articles "Quantum field lens coding and classification algorithm to predict measurement outcomes," at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2023.102136 , and "QF-LCA dataset: Quantum field lens coding algorithm for system state simulation and strong predictions" by Data-in-Brief, Elsevier J, accordingly.
 
6- Other codes are written in QI (QInspire) like “QDF-LCode (QI).txt” and their corresponding figures such as “QDF-LCode in QI.png” show a QDF circuit and measurement outcomes. Run the code by copy pasting its contents after creating a free account at  https://www.quantum-inspire.com/ as a new project. The actual code file is written as "QDF-LCode (QI).cq" with the exact content. 

7- A supporting poster(s) called “Graphical Abstract(s).pdf” is/are included describing the circuit and the summary of the QDF Lens Coding method and Algorithm. This is fully discussed in the method and data articles in “MethodsX” and “DIB” journals, mentioned in step no. 5 above.
 
8- For the complete method and more details, contact author about code details and method article(s).
