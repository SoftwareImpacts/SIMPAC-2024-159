The following is for VSCode software to run the pyhton file on Windows OS:

1- Change the VS Code Interpreter: VS Code program -> View -> Command Palette... (Ctrl+Shift+P) -> Python: Select Interpreter -> select "Python: Select Interpreter" (or Enter) -> select an interpreter based on our chosen Python version under which you have installed the package.

2- Install package under the correct Python version which means to change your default Python version and repeat the process of installation again. To change your default Python version (for Windows 10): Right click on This PC -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings (in the right panel) -> Environment Variables -> System variables (the bottom part of the window) -> double-click on "Path" -> Select the 1st row for the wanted Python version and move it up and then do the same with the 2nd row. I recommend to restart (close and open again) your Command Prompt session if you want to see/work with the new default Python version.

Note on installation: Following command (in Command Prompt or cmd) works: pip3 install pandas --user

======================================================

You can open a terminal in the current directory of the code as follows:
- Run the code by pressing Ctrl+F5 or selecting Debug -> Start without Debugging in VS Code environment.
- For missing packages to import modules from, use this Python syntax: pip3 install <package name>

- For generating documentaion and build the documentation site as you change code in this project,

pip3 install mkdocs

Then go to homepage (index) for more commands on MkDocs, or visit mkdocs.org.

- For generating documentaion and *.exe (under Windows OS) use,

pip3 install pdoc3

Then type after installation:

pdoc --html pdoc 

replace the "second pdoc" with your package / directory / filename to view the documentation of this project. For more information, visit: https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/

- Second method is, in the terminal you may run the following command to convert .py file to .exe on Windows OS.  
pip install auto-py-to-exe

Happy QAI-LCode_QFLCC.py code runs and coding,
